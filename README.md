# houdini-css-paint

An example of the CSS Paint API.

As of November 2018, *This works best on* Chrome and Opera.

To see if this has changed, take a look at [Is Houdini Ready Yet](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/).

Take a look at the assoicated Medium article, [How to be Houdini and escape the limits of CSS](https://medium.com/front-end-field-guide/how-to-be-houdini-and-escape-the-limits-of-css-460af7307d41) to learn a little bit about the CSS Paint API.

The [Demo](https://houdini-css-paint.sethcorker.me/) can be viewed in a browser that supports the CSS Paint API.
